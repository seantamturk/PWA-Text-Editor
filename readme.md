# J.A.T.E (Just Another Text Editor)

## Description

J.A.T.E (Just Another Text Editor) is a progressive web application (PWA) that serves as a text editor. It allows users to write and edit code or text files in a user-friendly interface. This project utilizes technologies such as JavaScript, CodeMirror, IndexedDB, and Service Workers to provide an offline-capable and installable text editor experience.

Through the development of J.A.T.E, I have gained practical experience in front-end and back-end web development technologies. I have learned how to implement offline capabilities, caching strategies, and data storage using IndexedDB. This project has enhanced my problem-solving skills, improved my understanding of PWA concepts, and provided me with valuable experience in working with modern web development tools.
